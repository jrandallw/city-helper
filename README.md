# The Mission

This is the very first commit for what will hopefully become an impactful social project. It will become an application that allows users to add available public restrooms, along with the codes, making it easier for the homeless and disenfranchised to have places to relieve themselves. Ultimately, we'll also partner with restaurants willing to feed the homeless for free, or a small fee, which can be paid for by sponsorships of those in the community.

More to come later, but we're going.
